Ingesting Brown Dwarfs into the Simple DB

BD_GOOD.CSV has a list of every spectral file to be ingested

...\_sources.csv files are just the source names, so duplicate observations are removed. This is just to create new sources in the simple database

...published.csv and ...unpublished.csv have all the spectra needed to be ingested to the corresponding names.
